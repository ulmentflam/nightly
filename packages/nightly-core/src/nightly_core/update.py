"""Self-update — pull the latest Nightly source and refresh skills.

Inspired by [`gsd-build/get-shit-done`](https://github.com/gsd-build/get-shit-done)'s
idempotent npm installer pattern: re-running it pulls the latest
package and re-drops the host-specific skill files so every repo
gets the new content without manual intervention.

Nightly's distribution is git-based today (via `install.sh` which
clones to `~/.local/share/nightly` and writes a `uv run` shim into
`~/.local/bin/nightly`). The update command:

1. Finds the source checkout by walking up from `nightly_core.__file__`
   until it hits a `.git` directory.
2. Fetches the requested version (`main` by default; can be a tag or
   commit SHA), checks it out, and runs `uv sync` to update deps.
3. Walks the current repo and re-runs `install("project")` for every
   host that's already installed there — so the new SKILL.md content,
   the rules block, and any updated Stop-hook command propagate
   without the user having to remember every per-host re-init step.

If/when Nightly publishes to PyPI, this module gets a parallel path
that calls `uv tool upgrade nightly` or `pipx upgrade nightly` — the
public API (`update_install`) is shaped to accommodate either.

    For git installs, this fetches + checks out the ref + runs `uv sync`.
    For unknown installs (PyPI, pipx), this raises — the caller should
    surface a message pointing the user at the right tool.

    `dry_run=True` performs the fetch but doesn't check out or sync —
    useful for previewing the upgrade.

    `reexec` is an injection point for tests; production callers leave
    it `None` and get `_reexec_into_new_source`, which replaces the
    current process so the downstream `refresh_repo_install` step
    runs with the freshly-synced modules loaded. The re-exec only
    fires when the source actually moved — same-SHA syncs reuse the
    current process to avoid pointless fork/exec overhead.

    `notes` is an optional accumulator the caller can pass in; when
    `pull --ff-only` fails (divergent history, network blip, ref
    mismatch) or when the remote is ahead but HEAD didn't move, a
    human-readable note is appended for the CLI to print. Without
    this, the silently-suppressed pull failure surfaces only as
    "already current" — exactly the failure mode that left a user's
    install pinned at a week-old commit despite repeated `nightly
    update` calls.

    Re-exec is the load-bearing piece: after `uv sync` swaps the
    nightly-core source on disk, the current process still holds the
    *old* `nightly_core` in `sys.modules`. Any lazy import after this
    point (`refresh_repo_install` does several, walking each host
    integration) resolves against the cached old namespace and fails
    with `ImportError` on any symbol added in the new version (most
    recently: `BUG_SKILL_MD` in Phase 9n). Re-exec is the standard
    fix — Python self-upgrade tools (`pip`, `uv tool upgrade`) all
